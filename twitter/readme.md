Dear Sabina and Nasia, hi! =)

So just wanted to make small note what needs to be done.

We have a file "twitter_out_sample.json" that contains some twitter API output information.
I whant you to do the following:

1) wrine the function to read the data from the file.
2) write the function to create the dictionary
3) write the function to print the value (input to the function is a key)

Please see the file "template.py" to see how the result can look like.
